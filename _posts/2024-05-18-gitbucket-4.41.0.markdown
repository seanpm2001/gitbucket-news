Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based self-hosting Git server [GitBucket 4.41.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.41.0)!

Here are major changes and new features in this version.

## Simplify pull request UI

Merge action in the pull request UI is simplified a little.

## Keyword search for issues and pull requests

Keyword search is supported in the search box of issues and pull requests view. If you search by keyword, it's redirected to the keyword serach results.

## Max diff display settings

Large diff could make the browser very heavy as it's rendered by JavaScript. You can avoid it by configuraing max files and lines limit in showing diff at the system settings.

## Adjust the default branch when cloning external repository

When creating a repository on GitBucket by cloning an external repository, the default branch has been set based on the default configuration of GitBucket. But it has caused an error at the repository viewer when the branch doesn't exist.

Since this version, either of `main` or `master` is automatically chosen when the default branch doesn't exist.

This release also includes some bugfixes, performance improvements, and internal library updates. See all closed issues in [4.41.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.41.0) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
