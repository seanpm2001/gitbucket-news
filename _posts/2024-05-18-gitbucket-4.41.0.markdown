Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based self-hosting Git server [GitBucket 4.41.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.41.0)!

Here are major changes and new features in this version.

## Simplify pull request UI

Merge action in the pull request UI is simplified a little.

## Integrate keyword search with filtering in the search box

Keyword search is supported in the search box of issues and pull requests view. If you search by keyword, it's redirected to the keyword serach results.

## Make max files and lines limit in showing diff configurable

Large diff could make the browser very heavy as it's rendered by JavaScript. You can avoid it by configuraing max files and lines limit in showing diff at the system settings.

## Adjust the default branch automatically when cloning external repo

The default branch is now automatically chosen from either `main` or `master` when creating a repository by cloning an external repository.

This release also includes some bugfixes, performance improvements, and internal library updates. See all closed issues in [4.41.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.41.0) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
